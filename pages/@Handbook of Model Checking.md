- [[Abstract]]
	- Graph-based games are an important tool in computer science. They have applications in synthesis, veriﬁcation, reﬁnement, and far beyond. We review graphbased games with objectives on inﬁnite plays. We give deﬁnitions and algorithms to solve the games and to give a winning strategy. The objectives we consider are mostly Boolean, but we also look at quantitative graph-based games and their objectives. Synthesis aims to turn temporal logic speciﬁcations into correct reactive systems. We explain the reduction of synthesis to graph-based games (or equivalently tree automata) using synthesis of LTL speciﬁcations as an example. We treat the classical approach that uses determinization of parity automata and more modern approaches.
