- [[Abstract]]
	- We survey definitions, known results, and open questions in the area of locally random reductions and explore the ramifications of these reductions in complexity theory. This paper is based on a survey talk given at the DIMACS Workshop on Structural Complexity and Cryptography, Rutgers University, New Brunswick NJ, December 1990. 1 Introduction We consider the question of whether a probabilistic polynomial-time machine A can compute a function f in the following manner. A interacts with one or more machines B 1 , . . ., B k that are not restricted to probabilistic polynomial time. At the end of the interaction, A can use the information obtained from the B i 's to compute f(x). However, the information that A sends to the B i 's is locally random. Informally, this means that no individual B i can use it to figure out what A's private input x is. This study can be motivated by the practical problem of using shared resources for private computations. For example, f may be a financial ...
